#Hello-World

This is a simple Hello World in Node.js.  This is as plain and simple as it can get. All we are going to do is display Hello World in the terminal.

Using your favorite text editor, create a file called server.js and type the following:

This first line is just a comment to help document or describe something in the code.
<blockquote>// Display 'Hello World!' in the terminal<br /></blockquote>

This calls the console.log function to display "Hello World!"
<blockquote>console.log("Hello World!");</blockquote>

and then save your file.  Next, all we need to do is run the file by typing the following command in the terminal:

node server.js

This will run the Hello World program.  <strong>Congratulations!</strong>  You just created and ran your first Node.js program.
