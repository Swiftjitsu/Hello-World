#Hello-World

This is a simple Hello World in Node.js.  This is as plain and simple as it can get. All we are going to do is display Hello World in the terminal.

Using your favorite text editor, create a file called server.js and type the following:

// Display 'Hello World!' in the terminal<br />
console.log("Hello World!");

and then save your file.  Next, all we need to do is run the file by typing the following command in the terminal:

node server.js

This will run the Hello World program.
